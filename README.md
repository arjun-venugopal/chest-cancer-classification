# Chest Cancer Classification

This project aims to classify chest cancer using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset of chest X-ray images to predict the presence of cancer. Early detection of chest cancer can significantly improve treatment outcomes and survival rates.

## Project Overview

Chest cancer classification is a critical task in medical imaging. This project leverages deep learning models to analyze chest X-ray images and classify them as cancerous or non-cancerous. The goal is to assist radiologists in making accurate and timely diagnoses.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Git
- Virtualenv

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chest-cancer-classification.git
    cd chest-cancer-classification
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Update the configuration files as needed:
    - `config/config.yaml`
    - `params.yaml`

2. Run the main script to start the classification process:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Configuration

- **config/config.yaml**: Contains configuration settings for the project.
- **params.yaml**: Contains hyperparameters and other parameters for the model.

## Pipeline

The project pipeline is defined in `dvc.yaml` and includes the following stages:
- Data Ingestion
- Data Validation
- Data Transformation
- Model Training
- Model Evaluation

## MLOps Practices

This project incorporates several MLOps practices to ensure reproducibility, scalability, and maintainability:

- **Version Control**: The project uses Git for version control, ensuring that all changes are tracked and can be reverted if necessary.
- **Environment Management**: Virtual environments are used to manage dependencies, ensuring that the project runs consistently across different systems.
- **Data Versioning**: DVC (Data Version Control) is used to version control the datasets and machine learning models, enabling reproducibility of experiments.
- **Pipeline Automation**: The project pipeline is defined in `dvc.yaml`, automating the stages of data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow is used to track experiments, logging parameters, metrics, and artifacts for each run.
- **Continuous Integration**: GitHub Actions are used for continuous integration, running tests and checks on each pull request to ensure code quality.
